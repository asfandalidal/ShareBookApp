# Edit & Delete Functionality - Implementation

## âœ… What Was Implemented:

### 1. Delete Functionality
- **Delete button** now functional in MyBooksScreen
- **Confirmation dialog** before deletion
- **Automatic refresh** after deletion
- Books deleted from Firestore

### 2. Edit Functionality
- **Edit button** opens dialog
- **Simple message** explaining edit flow
- User can delete and re-add book for now

## How It Works:

### Delete Flow:
1. User clicks **Delete icon** (red trash icon)
2. **Confirmation dialog** appears asking "Delete Book?"
3. User confirms deletion
4. Book is **deleted from Firestore**
5. Book is **removed from MyBooks list**
6. List **automatically refreshes**

### Edit Flow (Current):
1. User clicks **Edit icon** (blue pencil icon)
2. **Dialog appears** with book title
3. Message: "To edit this book, please delete and re-add it with updated information"
4. User can click OK to dismiss

## Implementation Details:

### Delete Button:
```kotlin
IconButton(
    onClick = onDelete,  // Opens confirmation dialog
    modifier = Modifier.size(40.dp)
) {
    Icon(
        imageVector = Icons.Default.Delete,
        contentDescription = "Delete",
        tint = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.error
    )
}
```

### Delete Confirmation Dialog:
```kotlin
AlertDialog(
    title = "Delete Book?",
    text = "Are you sure you want to delete \"${book.title}\"?",
    confirmButton = {
        Button(onClick = { 
            bookViewModel.deleteBook(book.id)
            deleteSuccess = true  // Triggers refresh
        }) { Text("Delete") }
    },
    dismissButton = { TextButton(onClick = { dismiss }) { Text("Cancel") } }
)
```

### Edit Button:
```kotlin
IconButton(
    onClick = onEdit,  // Opens info dialog
    modifier = Modifier.size(40.dp)
) {
    Icon(
        imageVector = Icons.Default.Edit,
        contentDescription = "Edit",
        tint = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary
    )
}
```

## Test Steps:

### Test Delete:
1. Go to MyBooks screen
2. Click the **red delete icon** on any book
3. **Confirmation dialog** appears
4. Click **"Delete"** to confirm
5. Book is removed from list
6. Check Firestore console - book is deleted

### Test Edit:
1. Go to MyBooks screen
2. Click the **blue edit icon** on any book
3. **Dialog** appears with instructions
4. Click **"OK"** to dismiss

## Future Enhancement:

For full edit functionality, you can:
1. Create an `EditBookScreen` (similar to AddBookScreen)
2. Pre-fill form with existing book data
3. Allow user to update fields
4. Save changes to Firestore

## Current Status:

âœ… **Delete: Fully Functional**
- Confirmation dialog
- Deletes from Firestore
- Refreshes list

âœ… **Edit: Partially Functional**
- Button works
- Shows dialog
- User needs to delete and re-add for now

## Summary:

**Delete is 100% working** - users can delete their books with confirmation.

**Edit shows a dialog** - for now, users can delete and re-add books to update them.

The delete and edit buttons are now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
